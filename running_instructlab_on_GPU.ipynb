    "# Overview\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates InstructLab, an open source AI project that facilitates knowledge and skills contributions to Large Language Models (LLMs). InstructLab uses a novel synthetic data-based alignment tuning method for Large Language Models introduced in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081). The open source InstructLab repository is available [here](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab) and provides additional documentation on using InstructLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the high level steps in the InstructLab processing, but does not run the full fidelity processing due to the limited GPU capability. The full InstructLab processing can be run via the [Red Hat AI InstructLab](https://cloud.ibm.com/instructlab/overview) service.\n",
    "\n",
    "InstructLab can take the form of an open source installation or a Red Hat AI InstructLab installation. In this notebook, we will demonstrate the open source version of InstructLab running on Colab with a GPU, broken into the following major sequential steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accepts one or more of Question and Answer (QNA) files as input\n",
    "1. Performs `yamllint` checks on the QNA files to verify their format\n",
    "1. Places the QNA files in the desired structure in a taxonomy\n",
    "1. Verifies the taxonomy by running the `ilab diff` function\n",
    "1. Generates synthetic data \n",
    "1. Trains with locally installed InstructLab\n",
    "1. Inferences with the newly trained model\n",
    "1. Downloads the trained model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook must be run within a Colab GPU runtime. You can check you are running with a GPU by selecting Runtime-> Change Runtime Type and confirming that a GPU Runtime is selected. While this notebook can be started on a free Colab account, the GPUs availabe with a free access do not have sufficient memory to run InstructLab training.\n",
